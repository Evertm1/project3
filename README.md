### Getting Started

You can access the [Route Creator](https://routefind.herokuapp.com/about/) here! This [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K5SbwLiw/project-3-planning) was used in the planning process, including our user stories, wireframes, and the ERD. In addition, our [pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eqTayhXysYI5qBv2TQ410lI_BT00qZ2r_rxpS-1_LxU/edit) contains our original intent, design, and additional planning information about the web site.



### Next Steps

Future steps or features to add to the app may include:

-  Allowing the user to use the Google API to set waypoints to craft a route
-  Adding a dropdown or autocomplete feature the search functionality
-  Creating the ability to expand photos by clicking on them
-  Making the app to re-route the user to a custom error page if the chosen route doesn't exist
